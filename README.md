# ISLR
This repository serves as my take on the [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) 
book by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.

Python is the language of choice. However, I will come back to use R at the later day for a second read. 

## Structure

The work is broken down by chapter that includes codes for graphs, labs, and exercise.
